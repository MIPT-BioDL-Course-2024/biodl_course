# biodl_course
A course on biological and medical applications of deep learning.

## Preliminary Plan

WIP

- Block 1. Classic NLP and Transformers
	- **Word2Vec**: Continuous Bag-of-Words and Skip-Gram. TF-IDF
	- Tokenization: BPE. Revisiting transformers: Encoders vs Decoders vs Full Transformers. BERT family, GPTs, T5.
	- Vector Search. Algorithms for fast nearest neighbors search.
- Block 2. Graphs
	- Classical graph methods. Centrality, clustering, DeepWalk, Node2Vec and Matrix decomposition.
	- Graph Neural Networks. **GCN**, GAT. Heterogeneous Graphs, a bit on Knowledge Graphs,RGCN.
	- Proteins. GNN in 3D, equivariance in deep learning. **AlphaFold 2**.
- Block 3. Images
	- Visual transformers. Self-supervision on images. SimCLR, DINO
	- Segment Anything models.
- Block 4. Reinforcement Learning
	- Intro to RL. Markov Decision Processes. Policy and Value. **Q-learning**. DQN.
	- Policy Gradient Methods. REINFORCE. **PPO**
- Block 5. Generative AI
	- LLM Applications. **RAG**, **Agents**, Chain-of-Thoughts and Co.
	- **Diffusion**. Generating images. *Schedules*.
	- Diffusion for chemical compounds, 3D structures (proteins and peptides). *Latent Diffusion Models*
